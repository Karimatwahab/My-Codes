          <h2>Why These places?</h>

               <h3>Mecca and Medinah </h3>
               <p>
                    Hajj is one of the 5 pillars of Islam, Hajj is performed in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Mecca is a sacred
                    ritual
                    that muslims from all the world perform to commemorate the trials and sacrifices of the Prophet.
                    I will love to perform Hajj for spiritual growth, self reflection, and renewal.
               </p>
