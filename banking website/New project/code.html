     <pre>
     We're talking away
     I don't know what I'm to say
     I'll say it anyway
     Today is another day to find you
     Shyin' away
     I'll be comin' for your love, okay?


     [Chorus]
     Take on me (Take on me)
     Take me on (Take on me)
     I'll be gone
     In a day or two


     [Verse 2]
     So, needless to say
     I'm odds and ends
     But I'll be stumblin' away
     Slowly learnin' that life is okay
     Say after me
     "It's no better to be safe than sorry"
  

     [Chorus]
     Take on me (Take on me)
     Take me on (Take on me)
     I'll be gone
     In a day or two
